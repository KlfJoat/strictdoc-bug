# When the REQUIREMENT_TO_SOURCE_TRACEABILITY feature is activated, StrictDoc
# looks for source files in the directory from which the strictdoc program is run.
# (and all subdirectories). This overrides that.
#source_root_path = "bin/"


# The * expands to any combination of symbols that represent a valid file name,
# excluding the forward and backward slashes, which limits this wildcard to
# only match a single directory.
# The ** expands to any combination of valid file name symbols, possibly separated
# by any number of slashes.


# When the REQUIREMENT_TO_SOURCE_TRACEABILITY feature is enabled, StrictDoc
# will include or exclude paths to source files.
# These stack, with include first.

# By default, StrictDoc copies its CSS/JS and other asset files to a folder named `_static`
# in the HTML output directory.
# Sometimes, it is desirable to change the folder name. For example, the GitHub Pages
# static website engine expects such assets to be found in the `assets` folder.

# StrictDoc uses caching when reading and writing artifacts.
# By default, all cache files are stored in the `output/_cache` directory.
# If a custom output directory is specified, the cache will be placed in
# the `_cache` subdirectory within that output directory.
# It is possible to override the default cache location.
# One reserved value for this parameter is $TMPDIR which makes StrictDoc
# generate temporary files in the OS temporary directory under `strictdoc_cache` folder.
